## History
```
This marks the end of unit 7 where we have learned working with Client Side Storage: uses cookies, sessionStorage, and localStorage to save and reuse user data across a userâ€™s session; Server Side Storage: saves user info to a database that can be reused across multiple devices and sessions and Firebase to accomplish this.And also covered working with Date objects in JavaScript using the Moment.js library.
